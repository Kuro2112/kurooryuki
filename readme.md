## 👋 Hey, I'm *someone learning Luau, not quite a "dev" yet*

> Knows enough Luau to break things, not enough to call myself a real dev (yet).

### 🙋 About me

Hi, I'm **Nguyễn Vũ** (you can just call me **Vu**).

- **Main language I'm learning**: `Luau` (scripting language for Roblox)  
- **Current level**: I can read and write Luau, but I still don't feel confident enough to call myself a **real dev**  
- **Goal**: Move from "script tinkerer" to someone who can build **clear, maintainable systems**.

---

### 🧠 What I'm learning

- **Luau basics**  
  - Using `local`, `function`, `table`, `module`  
  - Reading other people's code (sometimes slowly, line by line)

- **Programming mindset**  
  - Breaking big logic into smaller, readable pieces  
  - Avoiding "spaghetti code" (I still fail sometimes, but I'm trying)

- **Roblox scripting with Luau**  
  - How to structure files, modules, and game logic  
  - Learning to **debug and refactor**, not just "delete and rewrite from scratch"

---

### 🔧 Things I've touched so far

- Small scripts to:
  - Automate repetitive tasks  
  - Build simple systems in Roblox (UI, quests / bounty logic, etc.)
- Editing and patching existing code to:
  - Reduce bugs (or at least not create new ones)  
  - Make the code a bit easier to read (at least for myself)

I'm not a strong developer yet, but I **keep reading, tweaking, and learning step by step**.

---

### 📚 How I learn

- Reading existing code (even the really messy ones) to understand structure  
- Writing notes in `.md` files or comments in code for what I just learned  
- Asking AI / Google when I'm stuck, but always trying to:
  - Understand **why** something works, not just copy–paste

### 🤝 If you randomly found this profile

- **If you're a Luau / Roblox dev**  
  - I'd really appreciate any feedback, code review, or tips on how to structure things better  
  - I'm open to honest criticism as long as it helps me grow

- **If you're also learning like me**  
  - We can share learning resources, ideas, and motivate each other not to give up

---

### 🎯 Future goals

- Be able to build:
  - A few Luau / Roblox systems **from scratch** without asking for help every 5 minutes  
  - Code that is structured, commented, and has a proper `README` explaining how things work
- Contribute:
  - Some small scripts or modules to the community

---

### 📝 Final note

Right now, I'm **not a great dev**, but:

- **I know where I am**  
- **I know what I'm missing**  
- And **I'm trying to get better at Luau every day**

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Hopefully one day I can come back here and cross out this line:  
> "not good enough yet to call myself a dev."
